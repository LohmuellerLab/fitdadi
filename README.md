# fitdadi

This is an early version of our method to infer the DFE using dadi. 

A detailed manual will be coming soon. The Selection module can be loaded independently or you unzip the dadi installation files, and copy Selection.py and __init__.py into the /dadi/ subfolder of the installation files before running python setup.py install.

A simple Python script which creates the scripts and files needed to simulate with our DFEs is included in the ./scripts directory. To use, execute the script ./init_simulations.py.
