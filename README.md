# fitdadi

This is an early version of our method to infer the DFE using dadi. 

A detailed manual will be coming soon. The Selection module can be loaded independently or you unzip the dadi installation files, and copy Selection.py and __init__.py into the /dadi/ subfolder of the installation files before running python setup.py install.

Scripts and files needed to simulate from our models are in the ./scripts/ directory.
